# Simple Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. It allows two players to control paddles and compete against each other to score points by hitting a ball with their paddles. This game created as part of my personal journey learning Python. By doing this project, although incomplete, it gives me a lot opportunities to learn and understand programming a bit more.
